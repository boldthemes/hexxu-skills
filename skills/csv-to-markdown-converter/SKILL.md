# CSV to Markdown Converter

Use this skill when the task is to implement, debug, or refine code that converts CSV input into markdown output.

## What this skill owns

This skill is for requests where markdown output is the point and CSV parsing details matter:

- clarify the exact conversion target: markdown table, README snippet, or a richer markdown document
- inspect sample CSV inputs and existing code before changing logic
- choose a parser strategy that handles real CSV behavior instead of only toy inputs
- define output rules for headers, alignment, escaping, empty cells, and malformed rows
- implement the converter incrementally
- add focused tests and example fixtures
- surface ambiguities instead of hardcoding guesses

## What this skill should avoid

- do not parse CSV with a naive `split(",")` approach when quoted fields, escaped quotes, embedded commas, or embedded newlines are possible
- do not assume the first row is a header unless requested or strongly indicated
- do not silently drop rows, columns, or whitespace-sensitive content without telling the user
- do not overengineer with large dependencies if the language runtime or current project already has a solid CSV parser available
- do not bake one-off cleanup rules into a supposedly generic converter without making those rules explicit

## Default workflow

1. Clarify the requested behavior.
   - input source: file, stdin, pasted text, or in-memory data
   - output form: plain markdown table or richer markdown
   - headers: existing header row, inferred headers, or custom headers
   - options: column selection, renaming, ordering, alignment, filtering, sorting, row limits
   - malformed input handling: fail fast, warn, or best-effort rendering
2. Inspect the current state.
   - read existing converter code, tests, fixtures, and CLI docs
   - if there is no representative input, ask for or create a tiny fixture that includes likely edge cases
3. Lock down conversion rules before coding.
   - choose the parser strategy
   - define how to handle missing cells, extra cells, and blank lines
   - decide how markdown-sensitive characters are rendered inside cells
   - decide whether whitespace is preserved exactly or normalized
4. Implement in small steps.
   - parse input
   - build an internal row model
   - render markdown header, separator, and body rows
   - thread CLI or API options through cleanly
5. Validate with focused examples.
   - simple CSV with headers
   - quoted commas
   - embedded quotes
   - empty cells
   - pipes or markdown-like content inside cells
   - no-header or custom-header behavior when relevant
6. Report the result.
   - summarize what changed
   - call out assumptions and remaining ambiguities
   - show example output when useful

## CSV parsing guidance

- Prefer a real CSV parser from the standard library or an existing dependency when available.
- If the user explicitly wants a lightweight custom parser, warn about the limits and test quoted fields carefully.
- Treat these as first-class edge cases:
  - commas inside quoted cells
  - escaped quotes like `""`
  - CRLF vs LF line endings
  - blank lines
  - inconsistent column counts
  - leading or trailing spaces that may or may not be significant

## Markdown rendering guidance

- Default to GitHub-flavored markdown tables unless the user requests another markdown structure.
- Make sure cell content does not accidentally break the table:
  - replace literal newlines in cells with `<br>` or another requested representation
  - escape `|` where needed
  - preserve code-like text without making the output unreadable
- If alignment matters, render the separator row intentionally rather than leaving alignment accidental.
- If the source data does not fit well into a markdown table, say so and propose a better markdown representation.

## Testing guidance

When adding or revising tests, prioritize compact cases that prove the converter handles:

- a normal header row
- quoted commas
- quotes inside values
- markdown-breaking characters in cells
- empty or missing values
- malformed input behavior

## Output guidance

- For coding tasks, give a short plan, make the code changes, then summarize the resulting behavior.
- For one-off conversion requests, return the converted markdown and briefly note any assumptions.
- When requirements are ambiguous, ask the smallest clarifying question that would materially change the implementation.

## Trigger guidance

This skill should trigger when the user wants help with any of the following:

- building a CSV-to-markdown converter
- fixing CSV parsing bugs in markdown table output
- adding tests or CLI options to a CSV-to-markdown script
- converting CSV files or strings into markdown tables or markdown documents with careful handling of parsing and escaping

This skill should usually not trigger for:

- generic CSV analysis with no markdown output
- markdown editing unrelated to CSV data
- broad ETL or data-cleaning tasks that only happen to mention CSV
- conversions to HTML, JSON, or spreadsheet formats unless markdown output is central
